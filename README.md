🌫️ Air Quality Report Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

The Air Quality Report Dashboard is a data visualization project that analyzes air pollution levels across major Indian cities.
It provides clear insights into key air pollutants such as SO₂, CO, PM2.5, and NO, helping users understand pollution intensity, city-wise comparison, and long-term AQI trends.

The dashboard combines traditional environmental indicators with modern BI visualization techniques to support awareness and data-driven decision-making.
